## Developer note

Hello Sir, This is my final Submission for the frontend hiring challenge. I have created this app in React with Tailwind CSS as a design template. I have submitted this frontend challenge project from scratch because I was getting some packages configuration error while integrating the Tailwind CSS.

Further more, I just want to inform you about a specific detail regarding the implementation of the call archiving feature in the project. While working on the challenge, I reviewed the API documentation in the github description provided and found that there is no dedicated API endpoint for archiving all calls at once.

To address this, I implemented a solution that makes separate API calls to archive each call individually. This approach ensures that all calls are archived as required, even though it involves multiple requests.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on this implementation. I am more than happy to discuss this in detail during our next meeting.

Thank you
